<p>We all have this mind-set of changing the World for we are the New Generation that doesn't have any Fear of impacting people's lives with some Influence and Love from Our heavenly Father.<br /> Jeremiah 29:11 says that<q>For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</q></p>
