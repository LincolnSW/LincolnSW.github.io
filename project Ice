<h1 >Unframed Ice Cream!!!</h1>

<div class="p1">
<p>Unframed is an artisanal ice cream maker. “Artisan” means we make healthy ice cream from scratch, in small batches, from real and sustainable food.</p>

<p>We care about making the world’s best ice cream — including dairy-based, fruit-based sorbets, and nut-based vegan options. We also incorporate an array of superfoods as toppings and flavours like our famous “Blue Coconut” made with Blue Spirulina.</p>

<p>Our ice cream includes all-natural tastes that are sometimes subtle and sometimes complex, always with an obsession towards the perfect texture.</p>

<p>We serve classic flavors, often with a twist… and we love to take you off the beaten track to discover new and extraordinary combinations.</p>

<p>At any given time, we have 10 flavors on display that rotate depending on seasons, inspiration, and supply. We keep at least two sorbets and three vegan flavors at all times.</p>

<p>We’re very proud of our local roots in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
